[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is an open-source static site generator.

Hugo is used to build documentation for the Community Health Toolkit (CHT). [The dedicated repository](https://github.com/medic/cht-docs) powers the CHT documentation site at [docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/). The Hugo static-site-generator is being used with the [Docsy theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/docsy/).
