[CHT Agent](https://github.com/medic/cht-agent) is a hierarchical [multi-agent system](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/multi-agent) designed to assist with CHT development workflows. The workflow uses [LangChain](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/overview) and [LangGraph](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/overview) for orchestration of agents.
